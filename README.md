# WIP: elasticsearch-stig-baseline

InSpec Profile to validate the secure configuration of elasticsearch-stig-baseline, against [DISA's](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/index.aspx) ElasticSearch Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __ssh__.

The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Tailoring to Your Environment
The following inputs must be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```yaml
# IP address of the elasticsearch instance
elastic_ip: ''

# Port address of the elasticsearch instance
elastic_port: ''

# Path to elasticsearch home directory'<br>
es_home: ''

# Path to elasticsearch.yaml
elasticsearch_conf: ''

# List of managed access points
managed_access_points: []

# Elasticsearch admin
es_admin: ''

# Elasticsearch admin password
es_pass: ''

# List of superusers
es_superusers: []

# List of events to be logged
es_included_logevents: []

# List of events to be excluded
es_excluded_logevents: []

# Elasticsearch owner
es_owner: ''

# Elasticsearch group
es_group: ''

# Path to rsyslog.conf
rsyslog_conf: ''

# URI to the log aggregation system
log_aggregation_system: ''

# List of NSA-approved or FIPS validated cipher suites
approved_cipher_suites: []
```

# Running This Baseline Directly from Github

```
# How to run
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/elasticsearch-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t ssh:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

### Different Run Options

  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy 

If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)

When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile baseline for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/elasticsearch-stig-baseline
inspec archive elasticsearch-stig-baseline
inspec exec <name of generated archive> -t ssh:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline:

```
cd elasticsearch-stig-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive elasticsearch-stig-baseline --overwrite
inspec exec <name of generated archive> -t ssh:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
