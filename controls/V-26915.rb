Elasticsearch supports LDAP, Active Directory, and PKI.

If the external authentication is Active Directory; verify the following
settings.

$ cat config/elasticsearch.yml | grep -A 6 -B 6 'type: \\?active_directory'


 xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      realms:
        active_directory:
          type: active_directory
          order: 0
          domain_name: ad.example.com
          url: ldaps://ad.example.com:636
          unmapped_groups_as_roles: true | false

If these settings are not correct or missing, this is a finding.

If the external authentication is LDAP; verify the following settings.

$ cat config/elasticsearch.yml | grep -A 16 -B 6 'type: \\?ldap'

xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      realms:
        ldap1:

If these settings are not correct or missing, this is a finding.

If the external authentication is PKI; verify the following settings.

$ cat config/elasticsearch.yml | grep -A 6 -B 6 'type: \\?pki'

 xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      realms:
        pki1:
