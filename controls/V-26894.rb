As the application administrator (usually elasticsearch), check the xpack.ssl

correct, this is a finding.

$cat elasticsearch.yml | grep xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

If this setting is not present or set to true, this is a finding.

with 200 status:

$curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u <TEST_USER> -p <TEST_CREDENTIALS>
