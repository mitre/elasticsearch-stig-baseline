Check elasticsearch settings and documentation to determine whether designated
personnel are able to select which auditable events are being audited.


As the application administrator (shown here as 'elasticsearch'), verify the
permissions for ES_HOME:

$ ls -la ${ES_HOME?}

If anything in ES_HOME is not owned by the application administrator, this is a
finding.

Next, as the elasticsearch administrator, run the following CURL command:


$ curl -XGET  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u <TEST_USER> -p
<TEST_CREDENTIALS> https://<elasticsearch>:9200/_xpack/security/role

Review the role permissions, if any role is listed as superuser but should not
have that access, this is a finding."
